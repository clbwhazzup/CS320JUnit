# CS 320: Software Automation, Testing, and Quality Assurance
#### Reflection
##### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
* I can ensure my code is functional and secure by, first, reviewing the requirements many times before, while, and after coding. This is important to ensure nothing is missed, and therefore ensures functionality and security. 

##### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
* This is a more useful skill for there isn't a requirements list already. I will talk to the user to see what they want, write that into a basic requirements list, and break it down into programming requirements. At that point it will need to be reviewed to make sure there is no abiguity, which would require meeting with the user again, or redundancy, which may fall on me or the user to fix.

##### How do I approach designing software?
* In more professional settings, I would approach designing software like I just described. For my own projects, I find it a lot easier, at my skill level, to just start coding my ideas to see if the language will work like I think it will. I'm getting to a point where I could just take a professional approach, but I enjoy writing the code more than designing it.
